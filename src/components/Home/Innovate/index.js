          We build the working experience for ambitious small teams and big

          SP8 mono-workspace is gorgeous — fully enclosed, blazing fast
          internet. It comes with amenities that make you feel like you are in a
          coworking space, but with the privacy and focuses uniquely for you.
          Prime location in the heart of the city. Flexible payments. And yes,
          it’s located on top of Esta Eatery. To name a few.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working in SP8 is so delightful, you won’t want to stop on that one
          project that will make a history for your company.
